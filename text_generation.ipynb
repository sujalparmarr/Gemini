            "**How does it work?**\n",
            "This buying and selling doesn't happen on a street corner. It takes place on organized **stock exchanges**, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ. These exchanges act as intermediaries, ensuring that all transactions are fair and transparent. The price of a stock is constantly changing based on supply and demand, influenced by company performance, economic news, industry trends, and overall investor sentiment.\n",

            "In summary, the stock market is a vital part of the modern economy. It connects companies that need money to grow with individuals who want to invest their savings for potential future returns. While it offers the opportunity for significant financial growth, it also comes with risks, as stock prices can go down as well as up.\n"
